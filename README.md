## Technical Design

### Agile Design

An Agile approach to creating this app has been applied. GitHub's projects was used to track user stories and implement ideas based on their level of importance for allowing use of the app with no loss of functionality or user experience. Three categories were created indicating their level of importance, those were:
- MUST HAVE
- SHOULD HAVE
- COULD HAVE

By using AGILE methodology in this project I was able to deliver a site which had all required functionality and some more. Due to the time limit on this project I was not able to incorporate all initial listed features, but this is where an AGILE approach is great for app design. The project displays this by having User stories in the Done section and the ones which decided to be left for future put in the future implementations section of the readme.

The GitHub project can be found [here](https://github.com/users/jkingportfolio/projects/9)

### CRUD Functionality

Tick It handles data with full CRUD Functionality:
<br>
- Create -  Users can create, an account, profile, tasks, comments, packs, contact messages and watch objects.
- Read - Users can view the tasks, comments, packs of other users and also the profiles of these users.
- Update - Users can update their profile, password, posted tasks, packs and watch status of tasks via the interactive forms and buttons on the site.
- Delete - Users can delete tasks, comments, packs and watch objects via the interactive buttons on the site.

### Colours

The colour scheme for this application was kept minimal with a monochromatic theme kept in mind.

## Front-End

### React

The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript  

I used React for this application for several reasons:

 - Flexibility – Due to having a modular structure React code is easier to maintain compared to other front-end frameworks.

 - Speed – Creating sites/apps with React significantly increases the page loading speed as the entire page does not require to refresh and reload all components. Components are updated dynamically thus reducing the wait and load times, which affects user experience.

 - React Bootstrap - When used for styling and responsiveness React Bootstrap is a great choice as it comes with ready-to-use React built components thus taking away alot of need to create commonly used code from scratch.

- It is the most widely used library for developing social networking and media content applications - Sites such as Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb are all made with React.

- Reusability of components – Components can be created and re used throught the app with no need to re write code for the same features.

There were various components created and reused across this application.

- `<Asset />` - multi purpose component, used to display a range of items due to being passed props. Those include a loading gif, image with source and alt attribute or a message consisting of a paragraph.
  - Used in user story: 21

- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to display the relevant user profile picture. This component uses props which can specify the source of the image and also its size, an example of this components re-use ability is the image size on the profile page being bigger than that of the one in the Nav Bar yet it is the same component and source image used.
  - Used in user story: 18

- `<DropDown />` - resuable component, used to display the three dots option button based on the required rights of the user and the item in question for example if a user is on their own profile the drop down to edit the profile will appear, however this will not be the case when viewing other users profile pages. 
  - Used in user story: 27

- `<HighPriorityTasks />` - specific component, used to display a filtered result of all task with the priority status of HIGH.
  - Used in user story: 24

- `<NavBar />` - resuable component, used for easy navigation of the site. This component is re usable as it will display different icons based on a users logged in status. If no user is logged in a log in, sign up and contact icon will be available however if a user is currently logged in, the full range of icons will be available apart from log in.
  - Used in user story: 2

- `<PageNotFound />` - specific component, used to display a 404 page made up of an image file and return home button for when the page does not exist.
  - Used in user story: 31

- `<PasswordCriteria />` - re-usable component, used to display the validation criteria needed for a valid password entry.
  - Used in user story: 26

- `<ScrollToTop />` - specific component, used to produce a button that will show when the user reaches the bottom of the page, this will allow the user to quickly return to the top of the page without the need for scrolling.
  - Used in user story: 24

- `<TaskCompleteFilter />` - specific component, used to display a filtered result of all task with the complete status of incomplete or in-progress.
  - Used in user story: - This component is an extra feature

- `<TaskDoughnutChart />` - specific component, used to display a doughnut chart of all tasks completion status providing an easy visual indication of the tasks status.
  - Used in user story: N/A - This component is an extra feature

- `<TaskStatusTable />` - specific component, used to display a numbered table of all tasks completion status providing an easy visual indication of the tasks status.
  - Used in user story: N/A - This component is an extra feature

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| Pack not submitting the tasks array to the database | Although the database has been created in such way to accept a list of taks, it didnt seem to work when passing a list of task id's in the form. Tests were conducted which proved that a single entry could be entered, i decided to try and create a for loop to pass in each task to the pack one a time and this acheived the desired outcome |
| Task edit form wont submit if due_date is not set a value | Update due_date to be an empty string and a conditional if statement was placed in the form append which checked if due_date was left empty or null and if true it wouldnt append this field. This fixed the issue as the field in the database has blank and null set to True |
| Profile list only displaying the first 10 results in Infinite Scroll | fetchMoreData was properly implemented  |
| assigned to tasks wouldnt display in the assigned to tab | A filter was added that would filter tasks based on if the assigned_to id matched that of the profile owners |
| Tab active colour would revert to the default | Documentation for react bootstrap didnt mention that the css has to be over written by using activeClassName proprty. Once this was used the issue was resolved |
| Searching for tasks if the single letter Y is entered, tasks with a title that only includes a number will be displayed | I could not work out why this was the case therefore this has had to be left in as a known bug |
| When editing a pack, the data is not correctly pulled from the database thus resulting in the user having to remove all tasks and re select them | Due to time constraints i was unable to find a solution to this bug so i had to be left as a know bug. This bug still allows functionality although the user experience is slightly impacted due to this |
| Pack details not displaying list of associated tasks due to 500 error | Due to not having control over the status of elephant SQLs servers i had to leave this as a know bug. I did implement code to retry if a 500 error is returned however sometimes this exceeds the max retry of 3 times. This bug still allows functionality although the user experience is slightly impacted due to having to refresh the page manually in the occassional instances in which this happens |
